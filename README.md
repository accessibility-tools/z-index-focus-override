# z-index-focus-override
A bookmarklet to demonstrate a proposed 'sufficient technique' for ensuring a focus indicator is never obscured.

This bookmarklet is being released under an MIT licence, to match the licensing of the CSS-inject tool I used.

## Use of the CSS-inject tool
The CSS injector template for these bookmarklets came from the [CSS-inject tool](http://mcdlr.com/css-inject/) created by [DrummerHead](https://github.com/DrummerHead). Learn more on the [CSS-inject GitHub repository](https://github.com/DrummerHead/CSS-inject).
